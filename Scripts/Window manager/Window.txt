1. ABOUT
========
  Window is a simple program that allows you to hide, the main window
 of any program on your machine.  All you need to do to hide a window
 is know the text that is in the title bar of the window - This is as
 simple as looking at it.

2. USAGE
========
   To hide a program, just run WINDOW.EXE and pass the Title Text of the
  program that you would like to hide.  For example, to hide a copy of
  Telnet just run it like this

   Window Telnet

   Or if you have several copies of Telnet running, hide them all like this
 
   WINDOW "Telnet*"


3. Other options
================
  Window supports several command line options, here is a list of them
  [Now all args are recognised regardless of case]

    Option =   Result
   ===========================================================
    /SHOW       =   Show a hidden window
    /HIDE       =   Hide a window
    /TOP        =   Toggle the 'Window Always on Top' flag
    /MAX        =   Maximize a window
    /MIN        =   Iconize a window
    /LIST       =   List all windows currently visible .
    /LISTALL    =   List all windows, hidden and visible. *
    /LISTHIDDEN =   List only hidden windows.
    /KILL       =   Close the given window. **
    /?          =   Show usage info

  The window title that you specify may be an exact title, or possibly
 a wildcard expression.
  The wildcard expressions may contain the special characters '*', and
 '?'. 
  The '*' character will match any number of characters, and the '?' will
 match a single character.

  So rather than have to use:-

    Window Notepad - Untitled.txt

  It is possible to use:-
  
    Window "Notepad*"

  If using the special meta-characters you must put the term in quotes,
 or the Win 95 / NT command processor will attempt to expand them into
 filenames.
  In this, updated version, full regular expressions are recognised.


4. MISC
=======
  If you would like to have a certain window always hidden on startup, just
 create an icon for Window and place that icon in your StartUp group.  Make
 certain that you put the Title Text of the window you wish to hide on the
 command line of that icon's properties.

  You can show a hidden window by running Window like this:

  WINDOW.EXE /SHOW "Telnet*"

  Hiding an already hidden window or showing an already visible window has no
 effect.

(*)  Listall command suggested, and contributed by David Berlioz.

(**) This may not work - some programs will insist on bringing up a 
     dialog "Really Quit".

5. ABOUT
========

  Window was written, and compiled under Visual C+ v4.  Its source code
 is included, should you be interested in how the program works, or if
 you would like to improve / modify the app.
  If you like the program please send me an email...  After all I'm not
 asking for money, and I currently have a job!
